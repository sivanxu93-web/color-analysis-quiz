        "section1Body": "A color analysis quiz is a tool designed to identify your personal color season—Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter. Based on the 12-season color theory, it analyzes the undertones of your skin (warm, cool, or neutral), the contrast of your features, and the intensity of your eye and hair color. While traditional analysis requires an in-person appointment with a stylist, our **AI Color Analysis Quiz** uses advanced computer vision to perform this assessment in seconds, offering a fast, free, and accurate alternative.",
        "section2Title": "How to Do Your Own Color Analysis?",
        "section2Body": "If you want to try a DIY approach before using our AI, here are the basics: 1. **Vein Test:** Look at the veins on your wrist. Green veins suggest a Warm undertone; blue/purple veins suggest Cool. 2. **Jewelry Test:** Does silver (Cool) or gold (Warm) make your skin glow? 3. **Contrast:** Do you have a high contrast between your hair and skin (like Snow White) or low contrast? Combining these factors helps pinpoint your season. However, human bias often leads to incorrect results—which is why our objective **AI Color Analysis** is often more reliable.",
